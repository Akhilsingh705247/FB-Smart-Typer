		<h2>Smart Typer Help</h2>
		Smart Typer provides instant autocomplete suggestions in your Facebook chat.<br/>
		<b><i>The extension has been installed. Thank you for using it.<br/>
		Please take a few moments to read this help documentation, so that you can easily use it.</i></b><br/>
		This document provides a bit of in-sight into its use.
		<p>
			The extension icon is <b>not shown always</b>.<br/>
			It is shown in the browser address bar only when you open Facebook.<br/>
			If some <b>error occurs then the icon is not shown</b>.<br/><br/>
			You can click the icon to load a small popup which gives you four options namely, <b>Options, Help and Report Bug</b>.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/popup.png"><br/><br/>
			You can open all these pages from this popup and can report a bug in extension to help improve the extension(<i>you have to fill up a small google form for this).</i><br/>
			<i><b>Note:</b> If you are a developer and would like to contribute to this project, then visit its repo here :

			The word suggestions appear in a small box(called "<b>Suggest-Box</b>") below the place where you would be typing(the textarea).<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/suggestions.png"></img><br/><br/>
			
			Autocomplete suggestions are shown <b>only for words of atleast 2 letters</b>.<br/>
			
			When suggestions are not being shown it shows "<b>Nothing to suggest</b>" status in the Suggest-Box.<br/></br>
			<img src="images/nothing_to_suggest.png"></img><br/><br/>
			
			But, when it tries to find suggestions and does not find matching autocomplete suggestions in existing dictionary(<b>default Great Britain English  dictionary</b>), then it will show a button(yellow area which blinks 3 times) in place of Suggest-Box, showing the status "<b>Click to add this word</b>".<br/>
			If you think that you want this word to be used in for future autocomplete suggestions, then just click this button.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/click_to_add.png"></img><br/><br/>
			
			It will add the word to your Custom Dictionary which you can manage from <a href="options.html" target="_blank">Options</a> page.<br/>
			<i>Help regarding how to manage your Custom Dictionary is provided in Options page itself.</i><br/><br/>
			Now, in case suggestions for a word are available, <b>maximum 3</b> suggestions are shown at a time.<br>
			You can <i>focus</i> any suggestion using the "<b>Down</b>" arrow key which will highlight that word. The highlighted word will also appear as suggestion in the input area or textarea itself.<br/>
			<img src="images/autocomplete.png"></img><br/><br/>
			
			To move to next set of suggestions keep pressing the <b>Down</b> arrow key till you end at 3rd suggestion. After this one more <b>Down</b> arrow keystroke will show you next suggestion set, <i>if found</i>.<br/>
			To move back in suggestions list, press "<b>Up</b>" arrow key. In this way, you can use the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> arrow keys to navigate in suggestion list.<br/><br/>
			
			Now, to select a word and autocomplete it as in the suggestion simply use the "<b>Tab</b>" key or use your <b>mouse</b> to "<b>Click </b><i>(left click)</i>" on that word.<br/><br/>
			
			To summarize, use these keys:
			<ol>
				<li><b>UP</b> or <b>DOWN</b>: To navigate through suggestions.
				<li><b>TAB</b> or <b>MOUSE CLICK </b><i>(LEFT)</i>: To autocomplete the focused word.
			</ol><br/>
